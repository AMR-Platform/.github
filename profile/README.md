## ü•ä Technical Challenges

## 1. Encoder Signal Acquisition for MCU Integration

### Problem
Acquiring encoder readings from closed-loop stepper motors for sensor fusion and LIDAR-based mapping presented significant challenges. The quadrature encoder signals are typically designed to interface directly with the motor controller, making MCU integration complex.

### Attempted Solutions

#### Approach 1: Y-Junction Signal Splitting
**Method:** Split encoder signal lines using Y-junctions, directing one branch to the motor controller and another to the MCU.

**Results:** 
- Encoder counts showed significant offset from actual readings
- Motors exhibited vibration and jerky movement
- Signal integrity compromised due to impedance mismatch

#### Approach 2: Single-Mode Buffer Implementation
**Method:** Implemented 4-channel single-mode buffering using SN74HC125N ICs for all encoder channels (A+, A-, B+, B-).
| Quadrature encoder signal from 2 channels | Before and after buffering, Amplitude is reduced at the output unexpectedly |
|---------|---------|
| ![ Quadrature encoder signal from 2 channels](images/dualchannel.jpg) | ![Before and after buffering](images/buffered.jpg) |

**Specifications:**
- Buffer selected to match encoder slew rate and voltage levels
- Designed for proper fan-out capability
- Target frequency: Up to 3600 RPM motor operation

**Results:**
- Performance remained unsatisfactory
- Issues likely attributed to low-quality, locally sourced buffer ICs

#### Approach 3: High-Quality Buffers with Differential Receivers
**Method:** Combined imported SN74HC125N buffers with SN75157DR differential receiver ICs.

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate encoder reading up to 500 RPM with zero count loss
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Above 500 RPM: ~3 count loss per 2000 counts
- ‚ùå Count loss increased approximately quadratically with every 100 RPM increment

## 2. Mechanical Design: Wheel Selection and Ground Clearance

### Challenge
Initial 15cm diameter wheels provided insufficient ground clearance when integrated with the motor and chassis assembly, limiting the robot's ability to traverse obstacles.

### Solution
- **Wheel Upgrade:** Increased diameter from 15cm to 20cm
- **Custom Coupling:** Designed and manufactured a [custom motor coupler](images/CouplerTop.jpg)
- **Ground Clearance:** Achieved >4cm clearance to meet traversal requirements

## 3. PCB Design and Communication Issues

### Pin Mapping Complications
**Problem:** Rapid development cycle led to suboptimal pin assignments, resulting in one motor being controlled by a 10-bit timer lacking hardware-controlled CTC (Clear Timer on Compare) mode.

**Initial Workaround:**
-  Generated a 50 % duty-cycle ‚Äúpseudo-step‚Äù PWM. To span the full RPM range, we had to switch prescalers on-the-fly - acceptable for the first milestone, but sub-optimal.

**Solution:**
- Dual prescaler configuration to cover entire RPM range
- Successfully met first evaluation requirements

### Additional Issues Identified
- **Encoder Pin Mapping:** Incorrect pin assignments for encoder interfaces
- **USB Communication:** Instability due to missing external oscillator for MCU timing

### Next Steps
**PCB Revision:** A new PCB revision is planned to address:
- Corrected pin mapping for all motor and encoder interfaces  
- Integration of external oscillator for stable USB communication
- Implementation of lessons learned from current design iteration
